#### Prompt:

```
I’ve noticed some gaps in how we manage .env content for different clients and environments, as well as a lack of key documentation like troubleshooting guides and server setup instructions. I’m considering building a dashboard (which will require authentication) with the following features:
* Sidebar sections for .env, server-related documents, Node.js code-related documents, and others.
* Responsive form for .env files that includes validation, select boxes to verify accepted environment variables, and options to download, copy, or preview the .env content.
* Ability to view existing .env files for different environments, but in a non-editable format.
The goal is to make it robust, cost-effective, with a good UI and easy to maintain.
Please share your thoughts on:
* What additional features could be added.
* How it should be maintained.
* The tech stack you would recommend.
* Any other considerations or suggestions you'd propose for this project.
and note, I want the UI look and feel to be of the pallete as similar to postman application

Let's discuss about the requirement first and then design and let's build the application
```

#### Requirement

1. We need to have the .env file for the different clients and environments
2. We need to have the server-related documents, Node.js code-related documents, others documents (in markdown format)

#### Design

1. We need to have the sidebar sections for .env, server-related documents, Node.js code-related documents, and others documents
2. We need to have the responsive form for .env files that includes validation, select boxes to verify accepted environment variables, and options to download, copy, or preview the .env content.
3. We need to have the ability to view existing .env files for different environments, but in a non-editable format.

#### Tech stack

1. We need to have the Angular/Typescript for the frontend
2. We need to have the Node.js for the backend
3. We need to have the Express.js for the server
4. We need to have the MongoDB for the database

#### Considerations (Optional)

1. We need to have the authentication
2. We need to have the authorization
3. We need to have the role-based access control
4. We need to have the permission-based access control
5. We need to have the audit trail
6. We need to have the logging
7. We need to have the monitoring
8. We need to have the alerting

#### UI look and feel

- We need to have the UI look and feel of the postman application (color palette, form-fields, button, etc.)

### V1:

#### Application Context:
You are an AI assistant specializing in web development. Your task is to help design and implement a dashboard application for managing .env files, server-related documents, and Node.js code-related documents. The application should have the following key features:

1. A sidebar with sections for .env files, server documents, Node.js documents, and other categories.
2. A responsive form for .env files with validation, select boxes for environment variables, and options to download, copy, or preview content.
3. View-only access to existing .env files for different environments.
4. Authentication and authorization system.
5. MongoDB database integration.
6. Angular/TypeScript frontend with a UI similar to Postman's color palette and design.
7. Node.js and Express.js backend.

Provide detailed, step-by-step guidance on implementing these features, including code snippets, architectural decisions, and best practices. Be prepared to answer questions about specific components, security considerations, and scalability. When asked about UI elements, describe them in the context of Postman's design language.


#### Instructions:
Based on the above information, guide me through creating, setting up, and running this project with all the requirements, following best practices and production-grade standards. When necessary, include comments in the code (use JSDoc format for clarity).

Assume I am a developer with medium experience and an empty folder open. Walk me through each step, including:
- Relevant commands to run.
- Files to create.
- Code to paste in each file.
- How to test and validate the setup.

Ensure that everything is explained in a simple and clear way, with best practices in mind at every step.

<!-- 

This JSON structure should define the fields for the .env form generation. It should dynamically generate the form based on this JSON. To update the JSON file based on form changes, It should capture the form data and write it back to the JSON file on the server side.

{
  "envFields": [
    {
      "name": "ENV_VARIABLE_NAME",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter variable name"
    },
    {
      "name": "ENV_VARIABLE_VALUE",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter variable value"
    },
    {
      "name": "ENV_VARIABLE_TYPE",
      "type": "select",
      "options": ["string", "number", "boolean"],
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Select variable type"
    }
    // Add more fields as needed
  ]
}

To enhance accessibility, reduce complexity, and improve readability, please implement the following changes:

1. Create a three-column layout for the environment field names:
   - The first column should display the environment field name along with an information icon(on the right side of the field name closer to the end of the row). When hovered over, this icon should display a tooltip containing the field's description and default values.
   - The second column should contain the input control (such as a textbox, dropdown, etc.) displaying the current value of the field. This input control should be read-only.
   - The third column should contain the same type of input control as the second column, but it should be editable to allow users to modify the field's value.

2. When the save button is clicked, the form should be validated. If the validation is successful, the data should be displayed to the user in a modal popup for confirmation. After the user confirms, the data should then be saved to the server.
